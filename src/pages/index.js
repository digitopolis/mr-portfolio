			<p>I'm a web developer based in Brooklyn. In my previous lÌ¶iÌ¶fÌ¶eÌ¶ career, I've worked in production music for film and tv, managed the inventory of a rare book store, and run a small letterpress print shop. I love things both low- and high-tech, and I especially like collaborating with people to build (or break, and then fix) cool stuff! I specialize in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React.js but am always excited to learn and play around with new tech.</p>
